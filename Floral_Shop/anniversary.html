    <h1>Anniversary Flowers FAQs</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>What anniversary flowers should I send?</h2>
        <br><br>
        When it comes to anniversary flowers, you can never go wrong with a rose delivery. We offer a host of elegant rose bouquets and roses in all different colors, including pink roses, yellow roses, white roses, and even tie-dyed roses.
        <br><br>
        However, you don't have to go down this traditional route. Ultimately, you want to get flowers that your partner will enjoy. And here at Proflowers, we have plenty of other options in addition to classic roses. Choose from anniversary bouquets and arrangements packed with lilies, alstroemerias, and more when you shop our collection.
        <br><br>
        <h2>What color flowers for an anniversary should I send?</h2>
        <br><br>
        The color of the flowers depends on the person you're giving them to. Pink and red are the two colors most often associated with romance, but you can choose from all sorts of different colors. An arrangement with white flowers can look sleek and elegant, while more colorful flowers - like sunflowers or daisies, for instance - can inspire feelings of warmth and positivity in your significant other.
        <br><br>
        <h2>Consider the meanings behind flower colors when making your selection:</h2>
            <br><br>
            Red symbolizes passion and romance
            <br><br>
            White conveys innocence and purity
            <br><br>
            Yellow represents happiness and joy
            <br><br>
            Pink is associated with devotion
            <br><br>
            Lavender or lilac is said to convey “love at first sight”
            <br><br>
        Whether it's your first anniversary or your 30th, you can celebrate the momentous occasion with a special flower delivery that is sure to delight.<br><br>
